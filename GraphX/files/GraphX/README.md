# [GraphX Cinnamon theme][repo]
> Theme anyone can use as a Fix for a linux mint visual bug in start menu where the left scroll bar seems to tear. 
Made some color edits for visibility as some may not want the stark white colors of the Brunnera base theme.

## Installation
### Cinnamon Settings (recommended)
Go to `Settings > Themes` and search for "GraphX".

#### From source

**IMPORTANT**: Never edit CSS files directly. They are overriden at build.
